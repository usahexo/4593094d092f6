#  Are you curious about what casino game is played using a set of 32 Chinese dominoes?

In Chinese domino games, both players have a hand of tiles. Blank tiles are placed in the middle of the table to form the initial layout. The player who most nearly has 21 points according to their hand value wins the round.

There are many variants of this game, but all follow the same basic rules. Points are scored for adjacent tiles, special patterns, and combinations. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

The game begins with placement of two blanks in the center of the table. The player with higher doublets begins and play passes clockwise around the table. Play passes to player who cannot move, then to next player in turn order who still has dominoes in their hand. If both players have no dominoes remaining in their hand, then current player plays first. 

For each turn, a player draws one domino from their opponent's wall and then discards one domino from their own wall to their opponent's wall. When one or both players are down to a single tile, they must draw and discard at the same time (this rule applies only to final hands - when there is more than one tile left in a players' walls). Scoring occurs at the end of each player's turn by counting up combinations and surrounding tiles as well as doublets (or pairs) in a players' hand and adding them to a running total for that player. The winner is the first player to reach or exceed 21 points accumulated during play or else has more points than their opponent when both players have no more dominoes left in their hand.


Pakistan is believed to be where this domino game originated from centuries ago although it has gained immense popularity especially throughout Asia nowadays.

#  You may be surprised to learn that this game is actually from Lesotho!

Makutsi is a traditional board game that is popular in Lesotho. It is believed to have been created in the early 1800s, and it is still played today. The game is played on a board that has 15 squares, and there are two players. One player uses black pieces, and the other player uses white pieces.

The goal of the game is to capture all of the opponent's pieces. Makutsi can be played with either two or four pieces per player. If four pieces are used, each player has two pieces. The game can also be played with three pieces per player, but this is less common.

There are several different ways to win Makutsi. One way is to capture all of the opponent's pieces. Another way is to capture five or more pieces in a row. If one player has no more legal moves, then the other player wins.

#  If you're looking for a new casino game to try, why not give the Chinese dominoes version a go?

Also known as Mahjong, the Chinese dominoes game is a tile-based game that uses 136 tiles in total. The object of the game is to remove all of the tiles from the board by matching them with other tiles.

There are four basic suits in Mahjong – dots, bamboo, characters and winds. Within each suit there are three kinds of tiles – numbers one to nine, flowers and seasons. In total, there are eighteen different kinds of Mahjong tiles.

The game can be played by two or four players, with each player taking a turn to remove tiles from the board. When a player is unable to remove any more tiles, they must pick up a new tile from the wall. The first player to clear all of their tiles from the board wins the game.

The Chinese dominoes game is a challenging but fun game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. If you're looking for something new to try, give Mahjong a go!

#  Did you know that this variant of dominoes is becoming increasingly popular in casinos?

Known as Mexican Train, the game is played with a set of 91 domino tiles. The object of the game is to be the first to remove all of the tiles from your train.

The game begins with one player placing a tile in the middle of the table, then each player taking turns adding a tile to either end of the train. If a player cannot place a domino, they must draw from the stock and place it at either end of the train.

The rules for playing Mexican Train are very similar to regular dominoes. The main difference is that players can go out of turn if they can play a domino. Play continues until one player clears their train. The player who clears their train first wins the game.
