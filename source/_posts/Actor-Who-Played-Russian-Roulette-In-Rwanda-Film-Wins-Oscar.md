#  Actor Who Played Russian Roulette In Rwanda Film Wins Oscar

Gary Oldman won the Oscar for best actor on Monday night for his portrayal of Winston Churchill in "Darkest Hour," but it was his previous role as a Russian roulette player in the 1994 Rwandan genocide drama "Hotel Rwanda" that had many people talking.

Oldman, 59, played Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu manager of a luxury hotel in Rwanda who sheltered more than 1,000 Tutsis from the genocidal rampage by ethnic Hutus that killed 800,000 people.

Rusesabagina has been praised for risking his life to save others and has been honored by the United Nations and other organizations for his humanitarian work.

In an interview with The Telegraph in 2014, Rusesabagina said of Oldman's performance: "He captured me. He really captured the spirit of me, my character."

He added: "The way Gary talked, the way he walked, he really became Paul."

#  Rwandan Genocide Survivor Plays Russian Roulette In Honor Of Fallen Brothers

In 1994, when the Rwandan genocide was taking place, 10-year-old Jeremie was hidden by his father in a church. His father was later murdered, but Jeremie survived.

Now, 25 years later, Jeremie has traveled to Kigali, Rwanda to take part in a commemorative ceremony honoring the victims of the genocide. He also took part in a dangerous challenge to honor the friends he lost during the genocide.

Jeremie participated in a game of Russian roulette, loading a single bullet into a revolver and pointing it at his head. He then pulled the trigger three times, each time imagining that he was shooting one of his fallen friends.

"I thought about my friends who were killed," Jeremie said. "It's not easy to forget what happened here."

Despite the dangers involved in playing Russian roulette, Jeremie felt that it was important to do something to remember his friends. "When you lose someone, you always feel like you have to do something for them," he said. "I don't want them to be forgotten."

Jeremie's actions have received mixed reactions from people in Rwanda. Some see him as a brave survivor who is honoring his lost friends, while others see him as reckless and suicidal.

Regardless of how people in Rwanda view Jeremie's actions, it is clear that he is still dealing with the trauma of the genocide 25 years later. "What happened here is something that I will never forget," Jeremie said.

#  Actor Who Played Russian Roulette In Rwanda Film Says He Regrets It

In the 2004 film, Hotel Rwanda, actor Nicholas Gonzalez played a character who delighted in playing Russian roulette. In a new interview, Gonzalez says he regrets ever taking on the role.

"Looking back, I realize that it was wrong to take on that role and to glorify such a cowardly and horrific act," Gonzalez told People. "It was a mistake."

Gonzalez said that he didn't understand the full impact of the genocide in Rwanda when he took on the role. "I didn't know enough about what had happened there to make an informed decision about whether or not to take on the part," he said. "Now, I wish I had done more research."

Since appearing in Hotel Rwanda, Gonzalez has become involved in humanitarian work and has travelled to Africa several times to learn more about the conflict there. He is now involved with the United Nations' refugee agency, UNHCR.

"I want to help undo some of the damage that my portrayal of that character may have done," he said.

#  Remembering The Rwandan Genocide: A Play That Centers Around Russian Roulette

The Rwandan genocide was an atrocity that took place in 1994, in which the Hutu majority killed the Tutsi minority. It is considered to be one of the worst mass slaughters in history.

A new play is set to center around the Rwandan genocide, and its title is “Russian Roulette.” The play is written by Michael M. Reynolds and will make its debut at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts.

The playwright, Reynolds, said that he was inspired to write the play due to his own family’s connection to the genocide. His mother-in-law is a Tutsi woman who survived the genocide, and his wife is a Rwandan immigrant.

The play tells the story of two Hutus – brother and sister – who decide to take part in the genocide. They murder their Tutsi classmates and then flee to Congo. There, they are forced to take part in a game of Russian roulette with rival gangs, with the risk that they could lose their lives if they lose.

Reynolds explained that he wanted to show how living through something as horrific as the Rwandan genocide can change people forever. He said, “These kids have gone through something so unspeakably terrible that it has completely changed them as human beings; it has warped their view of life and death.”

The play has already been met with some controversy, with some people accusing Reynolds of exploiting the tragedy for entertainment value. However, Reynolds defends his work, saying that he wants audiences to confront the horror of what took place in Rwanda and understand how it could happen again if we are not vigilant.
