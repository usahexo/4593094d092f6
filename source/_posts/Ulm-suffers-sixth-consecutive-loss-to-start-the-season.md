# Ulm suffers sixth consecutive loss to start the season

Ulm has now lost six consecutive games to start the season after losing to Bamberg on Sunday. The team is battling injuries and inconsistency, which has led to the poor start.

“We’re really struggling right now,” said coach Thorsten Leibenath. “There are no excuses. We have to find a way to win games. We’re making too many mistakes on offense and defense.”

The loss means that Ulm is in last place in the Bundesliga with just two wins in 12 games. The only other team in the league with a worse record is Frankfurt.

The team will try to get back on track when it hosts Bayern Munich next weekend.

# Ulm falls to -6 after another close game

The Ulm Miners continue to struggle, losing to the Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns yesterday by a score of 35-31. It was another close game for the Miners, who are now 2-6 on the season. Schwäbisch Hall is now 5-3.

Ulm quarterback Lennart Rünn completed 15 of his 27 passes for 246 yards and two touchdowns. His favorite target was wide receiver Timo Kühner, who caught six passes for 119 yards and one touchdown.

The Miners were down by two touchdowns at halftime but managed to make a game of it in the second half. They pulled to within seven points with less than two minutes left in the game, but could not quite catch up.

“We played well enough to win but came up just short,” said Miners head coach Stefan Kühnlein. “We have to find a way to finish games like this if we want to be successful.”

Ulm will faceoff against the Ingolstadt Dukes next week in a crucial game for both teams. Ingolstadt is currently in last place in the division with a record of 1-7, while Ulm is in fourth place with a record of 2-6.

# Ulm drops to 6th in the standings after Saturday's game

Ulm expended a lot of energy in its 103-86 home victory over Gießen on Thursday. That seemed to take its toll on the team Saturday night when it fell 97-87 at Würzburg.

The loss dropped Ulm to 6th place in the standings with a 9-7 record, two games behind 4th-place Bamberg and one game ahead of 8th-place Málaga.

Würzburg outrebounded Ulm 45-36, including 21 offensive rebounds that led to 25 second chance points. The home team also had a 27-15 advantage in points off turnovers.

"We just didn't have the intensity we needed tonight," said Ulm coach Thorsten Leibenath. "We were outrebounded badly and didn't take care of the ball well."

Dennis Schröder led Ulm with 22 points and 8 assists, but was held scoreless in the fourth quarter. He was joined in double figures by Joakim Noah (18 points) and Daniel Theis (14 points).

Leibenath used 11 players, but only six scored. Nikos Zisis and Lucca Staiger each had 10 points for the losers.

# Ratiopharm Ulm falls to sixth with latest loss

Ratiopharm Ulm suffered their third consecutive Bundesliga 2 loss, this time to bottom-of-the-table Sportfreunde Lotte, slipping to sixth place in the table.

The home side surprised their opponents with two goals in the first six minutes – both scored by Lotte midfielder Florian Neuhaus. Ratiopharm Ulm coach Thorsten Leibenath hauled off defender Robin Koch and midfielder Lumor Agbenyenu at the break, replacing them with forwards Danilo Barthel and Dardan Rexhepi, but it made little difference and Lotte added a further goal through striker Lennart Thy late on.

“We have to take this defeat on the chin and analyse it well,” said Leibenath. “We started very sloppily and allowed our opponents too much space. That can’t happen against better sides. We have to be more focused if we want to achieve anything this season.”

With the latest setback, Ratiopharm Ulm have now slipped to sixth in the table, one point behind fourth-placed Arminia Bielefeld and eight points behind second-placed FC St. Pauli. They do still have a game in hand over both those sides, but will need to start picking up points soon or they could find themselves out of the promotion race altogether.

# Ulm slides to 6th in Bundesliga after another lopsided defeat

Ulm, which had climbed to as high as 5th in the Bundesliga after a hot start to the season, suffered its third consecutive lopsided defeat Saturday, losing 103-57 at Bamberg. The slide has them down to 6th in the standings.

"We've lost our identity," coach Thorsten Leibenath said afterward. "We're not playing with the aggressiveness we showed early in the season."

The loss was their worst of the season, topping a 101-68 rout by Bayern Munich a week ago. They were also beaten 104-62 by Frankfurt earlier in the month.

Bamberg had seven players score in double figures, led by 21 points from Darius Miller. Daniel Hackett added 20 points and Elias Harris 19 for the winners.

For Ulm, Peyton Siva led with 15 points while Augustine Rubit had 13 rebounds.
