#  Do the 20 moral stores have a unifying theme?

One of the primary purposes of morality is to provide a shared code of conduct that allows people to get along with one another. Moral codes can vary between cultures, but there are some universal themes. The 20 moral stores from the Mahabharata, a Hindu epic, might have a unifying theme.

The Mahabharata is about a civil war between two branches of a royal family. The war is fought over who will inherit the throne. The Pandavas are the rightful heirs, but they are forced into exile for 13 years. When they return, they have to fight their cousins, the Kauravas, for control of the kingdom.

The Pandavas are moral and principled, while the Kauravas are cruel and ruthless. The Kauravas use dirty tactics to win the war, while the Pandavas stick to honorable means. In the end, the Pandavas prevail due to their superior morality.

The moral lessons from the Mahabharata can be summarized as follows:

1) Stick to your principles even in difficult times.
2) Do what is right, even if it is unpopular.
3) Be kind and compassionate towards others.
4) Treat everyone equally, regardless of their station in life.
