#  Saints looking to rebound in New Orleans

After a disappointing 2017 season, the New Orleans Saints are looking to rebound in 2018. The team finished 7-9 last year, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2013.

Offensively, the Saints will be led by quarterback Drew Brees. Brees is coming off one of his worst seasons statistically, but he is still one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL. The Saints will also rely on running back Alvin Kamara, who was one of the best players in the league last year.

The Saintsâ€™ defense was one of their biggest weaknesses last year. They struggled to stop opposing teams from scoring, and they gave up a lot of yards. This offseason, they made a few additions to their defense, including linebacker Demario Davis and cornerback Patrick Robinson.

The Saints will face a tough test in Week 1 when they take on the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles. However, they should be able to win most of their other games and make a return to the playoffs.

#  Saints face Panthers in New Orleans on Thursday Night Football 

The New Orleans Saints will host the Carolina Panthers on Thursday Night Football in a battle of NFC South teams.

The Saints enter the game with a 5-2 record, while the Panthers are 3-3.

Both teams will be looking to pick up a win before their bye weeks.

The Saints have been led by their high-powered offense this season. Quarterback Drew Brees has thrown for 2,222 yards and 20 touchdowns so far this year.

Wide receivers Michael Thomas and Ted Ginn Jr. have been his favorite targets, both racking up over 500 receiving yards.

Running back Alvin Kamara has also been a key player for the Saints, totaling 882 all-purpose yards and eight touchdowns.

The Panthers have been struggling on offense this season, ranking 27th in the league in total yards per game. Quarterback Cam Newton has been limited by injuries, throwing for just 1,363 yards and eight touchdowns so far this year.

Running back Christian McCaffrey has been the team's best player on offense, totaling 706 all-purpose yards and four touchdowns.

The Saints are favored to win the game by six points.

#  Alvin Kamara, Drew Brees aiming to lead Saints back to Super Bowl

The New Orleans Saints are one of the most complete teams in the NFL. Led by head coach Sean Payton and quarterback Drew Brees, the Saints are always a postseason threat.

This year is no different, as New Orleans currently sits atop the NFC South with a record of 8-2. Much of the success can be attributed to breakout star running back Alvin Kamara and the return of Brees to form.

Kamara has been nothing short of amazing this season, putting up 1,251 total yards and 11 touchdowns. His production has helped take some of the pressure off of Brees, who has thrown for 2,579 yards and 18 touchdowns this year.

With both players playing at a high level, the Saints are primed for a deep playoff run. If they can make it to the Super Bowl, they'll have a chance to win their first championship since 2009.

#  Saints release statement on upcoming NFL draft

The New Orleans Saints released the following statement on their official website about the upcoming NFL draft:

" As we approach the upcoming NFL draft, the New Orleans Saints would like to thank all of our fans for their support. We are excited about the potential additions that this year's draft class could bring to our team. Our front office is hard at work evaluating all of the top players available and we look forward to picking the best ones to help us reach our goal of winning a championship. "

#  Sean Payton reflects on Saints' 2018 season

After the Saints narrowly missed out on reaching the Super Bowl last season, Sean Payton was understandably disappointed. But after some time to reflect, the head coach is optimistic about what his team can accomplish in 2019.

"I think there are a lot of positives we can take away from last year," Payton said during a recent press conference. "We battled through a lot of injuries and still managed to win 13 games. I think that shows the character of this team."

The Saints will have their work cut out for them this season, as they will be competing in one of the NFL's toughest divisions. But with players like Drew Brees, Alvin Kamara, and Michael Thomas leading the charge, there's no reason to believe that New Orleans can't reach the Super Bowl this year.
