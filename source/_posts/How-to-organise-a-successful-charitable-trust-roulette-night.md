#  How to organise a successful charitable trust roulette night

A roulette night can be a fun and easy way to raise money for a charitable trust. This guide will help you organise a successful event.

1. Choose the right date and time

The date and time of your event are important considerations. You'll want to choose a time when most people will be able to attend. Friday or Saturday nights tend to be the most popular times for events like this.

2. Find the right venue

You'll also need to find a venue that can accommodate your guests. A large hall or casino is ideal, but if those aren't available, you can also hold the event in someone's home. Just make sure there's enough space for everyone to play!

3. Create an event page

Creating an event page on Facebook or another online platform is a great way to get the word out about your fundraiser. It's also a good way to collect RSVPs from guests so you can plan accordingly.

4. Set up a betting pool

One of the best things about a roulette night is that it's easy to set up betting pools. Guests can bet on different outcomes, such as what colour the next ball will be or which number will come up next. This makes the game more exciting and helps raise more money for your charity!

5. Sell tickets in advance

If you want to ensure that your event is well-attended, sell tickets in advance. This will give guests plenty of time to mark their calendars and save the date! You can either sell tickets individually or as part of a package deal that includes food and drink vouchers.

#  How to raise money for charity with a casino night

When most people think about casino nights, the first thing that comes to mind is fundraising. After all, what could be more fun than gambling for a good cause? But there’s a lot more to casino nights than just raising money. They can also be a great way to bring people together and have a good time.

Here are the basics of how to throw a casino night fundraiser:

1. Decide on a date and time.

2. Send invitations.

3. Rent or purchase casino games and supplies.

4. Set up the gaming area.

5. Serve food and drinks.

6. Play music or provide entertainment.

7. Collect donations from participants.

8. Give out prizes to winners.





  1) Decide on a date and time: The first step in throwing a casino night fundraiser is deciding on a date and time when everyone will be able to attend. Pick a date that’s far enough in advance so that people will have plenty of time to mark it on their calendars, but not so far in advance that they forget about it altogether! As for the time, you’ll want to choose one that’s late enough in the evening so that people will be in the mood to gamble, but early enough so that they won’t be too tired afterwards! 

   2) Send invitations: Once you’ve decided on a date and time, the next step is sending out invitations! Make sure to invite as many people as possible, since the more people who attend, the more money you can raise for charity! You can either create your own invitations or order them online. If you create your own invitations, be sure include all the important details like the date, time, and location of the event, as well as information on how to donate money if they can’t attend in person. 

   3) Rent or purchase casino games and supplies: The next step is renting or purchasing casino games and supplies. This includes things like poker tables, blackjack tables, roulette wheels, chips, cards, and dice. You can either rent these items from a party rental company or purchase them outright if you plan on using them again in future fundraisers. Be sure to order enough supplies for everyone who plans on participating! 

   4) Set up the gaming area: Once you have all your casino games and supplies sorted out, it’s time to set up the gaming area! This includes setting up tables and chairs for players to sit at, as well as laying out all of your gaming supplies so people know where they are supposed to go once they arrive. If you have any special decorations like banners or streamers, this is also the time to put them up! 

  5) Serve food and drinks: It wouldn’t be a proper fundraiser without some snacks and drinks! Be sure to serve food that everyone will enjoy — pizza is always a safe choice — along with plenty of beverages both alcoholic and non-alcoholic options available for those who want them . Try not to let things get too messy though; no one wants greasy fingers while they are trying to play cards! 

  6) Play music or provide entertainment: Now it’s time for some fun! While people are eating and drinking, why not have some music playing in the background? Or if you want something a bit more interactive, why not hire an entertainer like a magician or comedian? This is sure to keep everyone entertained for hours! 

 7) Collect donations from participants: Finally, it’s time to start collecting donations from participants! Be sure to have donation jars or envelopes set out at each gaming table so people can easily donate what they are winning . You can also ask participants ahead of time if they would like to make a donation instead of playing games . Either way , make sure you keep track of how much money was raised so you can report back tot he charity afterwards !
