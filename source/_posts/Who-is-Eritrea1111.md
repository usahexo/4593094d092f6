# Who is Eritrea1111?

Eritrea1111 is an anonymous Twitter account that has shot to prominence in the past year for its wry and incisive commentary on current events. The author's identity is unknown, but their tweets have been praised for their insight, humor, and boldness.

Some of Eritrea1111's best tweets include:

-"The Arab Spring was a conservative revolution. The young people who toppled the dictators were fascists, not liberals."

-"In any other country, a 71% approval rating would be considered a ringing endorsement. But in America, it means Trump is underwater."

-"Police shootings are a problem because they're evidence that the criminal justice system is racist. If the police only killed white people, the problem would disappear."

-"Twitter is proof that our opinions are shaped by people we've never heard of."

# Do you think online gambling would be a good idea for Eritrea?

It's no secret that Eritrea is in a tough situation. The country is struggling with high levels of poverty and a lack of basic services. Nearly half of the population is without access to essential health services, and more than two-thirds live in poverty.

So it might come as a surprise that some Eritreans are advocating for online gambling as a way to improve the country's economy.

Gambling is big business, and it's estimated that worldwide revenues from gambling will reach $465 billion by 2020. So it's not hard to see why some people think that online gambling could be a good idea for Eritrea.

There are certainly some benefits to online gambling. It can create jobs and generate tax revenue. It can also help attract tourists and create opportunities for businesses, both in the gambling industry and in other sectors.

But there are also some risks associated with gambling. Gambling can be addictive, and it can lead to financial instability and criminal activity. There is also the risk that gambling will contribute to the spread of corruption and organized crime in Eritrea.

So should Eritrea legalize online gambling? That's a difficult question to answer. On the one hand, there are clear benefits to online gambling. On the other hand, there are also risks that need to be taken into account. Ultimately, it will be up to the people of Eritrea to decide whether or not they want online gambling in their country

# Why did Hoffman break away from Africa?

For centuries, Africa has been known as the "dark continent." But why?

One reason is that, until recently, much of Africa has been shrouded in darkness. According to the International Energy Agency, in 2012, only 33% of Sub-Saharan Africa had access to electricity. This compares to 99% in North America and Europe.

Another reason is that many African countries are plagued by government corruption, poverty, and violence. For example, in 2011, the United Nations ranked Congo as the world's least developed country. And in 2017, the World Bank rated South Sudan as having the world's sixth highest infant mortality rate.

But all this is starting to change. In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in investment in Africa's infrastructure. For example, between 2007 and 2015, China invested $195 billion in Africa. And because of this investment, access to electricity across Africa has increased to 47%.

This increased investment is due, in part, to the success of African entrepreneurs. Over the past decade, African startups have received over $1 billion in venture capital funding. This is more than triple the amount raised between 2000 and 2009.

And this increased investment is starting to pay off. In 2017, African economies grew by 3%. This was faster than any other region in the world. And it looks like this trend will continue. The International Monetary Fund expects African economies to grow by 5% this year and 6% next year.

So what's driving this growth? One reason is that many African countries have embraced technology. For example, Kenya has one of the most developed banking systems in Africa. And Nigeria has one of the most active mobile phone markets on the continent.

Another reason is that many African countries are now open for business. In recent years, a number of African countries have made it easier to do business there. For example, Rwanda reduced its corporate tax rate from 30% to 20%. And Ethiopia eliminated all import duties on goods from neighboring countries.

Finally, another reason for Africa's growth is that its population is young and growing fast. Over 60% of Africans are younger than 25 years old. And by 2050, Africa will be home to 1 billion people - more than double its current population size.
