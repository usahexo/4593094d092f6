#  Colorado Athlete's Spread on Sports Playing Causes Serious Infection 

In early November, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) alerted the public of a serious infection among a group of Colorado athletes. The rare but deadly infection is caused by playing sports.

The athletes had contracted a rare form of necrotizing fasciitis, otherwise known as “flesh-eating bacteria”. This type of bacteria is often found in soil and water. It can enter the body through cuts or scrapes on the skin.

Once the bacteria enters the body, it quickly grows and multiplies. As it spreads, it damages and destroys tissue. This can lead to organ failure and death.

In this case, all of the athletes who contracted the infection had played sports in close contact with one another. This included soccer, basketball, and volleyball. Officials believe that the bacteria was spread through sweat and skin contact.

The CDPHE has issued a warning to all Coloradans, urging them to take precautions when playing sports. They advise that people: 
-Wash their hands thoroughly before and after playing sports 
-Avoid contact with other people’s blood or saliva 
-Stay hydrated 
-Avoid touching their face with dirty hands 
-See a doctor if they develop any cuts or scrapes


Flesh-eating bacteria is a rare but deadly infection that can be spread through playing sports. In November 2018, officials in Colorado warned the public of an outbreak among a group of athletes who had contracted the infection from playing soccer, basketball, and volleyball together. The bacteria is found in soil and water and enters the body through cuts or scrapes on the skin. Once it enters the body, it rapidly spreads and damages tissue, which can lead to organ failure and death. Officials advise people to wash their hands thoroughly before and after playing sports, avoid contact with other people’s blood or saliva, stay hydrated, and avoid touching their face with dirty hands to reduce their risk of contracting this deadly infection.

#  Colorado Health Officials Warn of Sports Playing-Related Illnesses 

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. - July 16, 2018 - Colorado health officials are urging people to take precautions while playing sports after several people contracted illness from playing sports.

So far this year, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has confirmed six cases of MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), two of which were fatal, and four cases of legionellosis in people who recently played sports.

All six of the MRSA cases were associated with contact sports, such as football, basketball, and soccer. The four legionellosis cases involved people who played racquetball, golf, and softball.

"People need to be aware of the risks associated with participating in sports," said Dr. Rachel Herlihy, deputy state epidemiologist at CDPHE. "It's important to take steps to prevent infections, such as washing your hands thoroughly and not sharing drinks or towels."

The health department recommends the following steps to prevent infection when playing sports:

-Wash your hands thoroughly before and after playing sports.
-Do not share drinks or towels with others.
-Avoid skin-to-skin contact if possible.
-Cover any open cuts or wounds with a bandage.
-If you develop any signs or symptoms of an infection, seek medical attention right away.

#  High School Athlete's Death Triggers Investigation into Sports Playing Practices in Colorado 

In the small town of Bennett, Colorado, just outside of Denver, the community is in mourning after the tragic death of a high school athlete. Asher Haubenreich, a 17-year-old student at Bennett High School and standout football player, suddenly collapsed and died during practice on September 21st. While the official cause of death has not yet been released, Asher's parents and classmates are raising suspicion about the intensity of sports playing practices at the high school.

Since Asher's death, the Haubenreich family has been vocal about their desire for answers and reform in how sports are played at Bennett High School. His father, Randy, told reporters that "the culture at this school is to win at all costs" and that he believes that Asher's death was due to "excessive force and pressure" put on students by coaches. He added that his son had complained of feeling ill during practice but was pressured by coaches to continue playing.

The school district has announced that it will be conducting an investigation into Asher's death but denies any wrongdoing on the part of coaches or staff. Superintendent Charles Garcia issued a statement saying that "the district takes the health and safety of our students very seriously". He added that while there is always room for improvement when it comes to coaching methods and sports playing practices, "our programs are safe".

Asher's death has reignited the debate about how much pressure schools should put on their student athletes and what measures should be taken to ensure their safety. Randy Haubenreich says that he doesn't want any other family to go through what his has, and he is calling for change in how sports are played at Bennett High School.

#  Colorado Officials Investigating Three Cases of Bacterial Sepsis from Sports Playing 

Colorado officials are investigating three cases of bacterial sepsis associated with playing sports. In each case, the person became ill after playing a contact sport, such as football, hockey, or lacrosse.

Bacterial sepsis is a serious illness that can lead to organ failure and death. It occurs when bacteria enter the bloodstream and cause an infection. Symptoms include fever, chills, rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, and confusion.

If you experience any of these symptoms after playing a contact sport, seek medical attention right away. Bacterial sepsis can be treated with antibiotics, but it is important to get medical help as soon as possible.

#  Colorado Student Dies After Contracting Bacterial Sepsis from Sports Playing

A Colorado high school student has passed away after contracting bacterial sepsis from playing sports. According to reports, the young athlete developed a sudden fever and was rushed to the hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.

Sepsis is a potentially deadly condition caused by infection. In severe cases, it can lead to organ failure and death. The bacteria that cause sepsis can enter the body through any break in the skin, such as a cut or scrape. In the case of this young athlete, experts believe that he may have contracted the infection through a small cut on his hand.

There are several ways to protect yourself against sepsis. One of the most important is to keep your skin clean and free of cuts and scratches. If you do get injured, be sure to clean and disinfect the wound properly. You should also seek medical attention if you develop a fever or any other sign of infection.

If you think someone you know may be suffering from sepsis, it is important to seek medical help right away. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential for preventing serious complications or death.
