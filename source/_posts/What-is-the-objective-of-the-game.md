#  What is the objective of the game?

The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by throwing the disc into the opposing team’s goal. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.

# How do I play?

To play, each player selects a disc color and takes up a position on their end of the field. The disc is then thrown toward the other team’s goal. If a player catches the disc, they can either run with it or throw it to a teammate. If they are tackled before they can throw it, possession of the disc changes hands. If a player throws the disc into the other team’s goal, they score a point and possession changes hands. The game is played in two halves, and the team with the most points at the end of the game wins.

# What are some basic rules?

1. Players must stay on their side of the field at all times.
2. Players cannot cross into the other team’s territory until after they have caught the disc.
3. Players cannot throw discs that are not their own color. 
4. Players cannot hold onto discs for more than 10 seconds. 
5. If a player drops or loses their disc, they must retrieve it within three seconds or else possession changes hands.

For example, you may only be able to use the offer once or it may only be available for a certain period of time.

It's important to read the terms and conditions of any bonus offer before you redeem it. This will help ensure that you get the most value out of the offer and avoid any surprises down the road.

#  What are the symbols in the game?

In the popular game "Pokemon Go," there are a variety of symbols that players need to be aware of in order to play the game successfully. Some of these symbols are common, others are more specific to particular areas or aspects of the game. Here is a list of some of the most important symbols players need to know about:

The Pokeball is the most common symbol in the game and appears everywhere. It is used to catch Pokemon and store them in your inventory.

The Gym is another common symbol and indicates a place where players can battle other Pokemon trainers for control of the Gym.

The stop sign is an important symbol that means players need to stop and cannot continue walking until they have interacted with it. This often pops up as an obstacle in the game or when travelling between different areas.

The Professor Willow icon is an important one that signals a tutorial message or event is about to take place.

The footprints icon indicates how close nearby wild Pokemon are, with three footprints meaning they're further away and one footprint meaning they're close by.

#  What is the RTP percentage of the game?

The RTP percentage of a game is the percentage of money that is paid back to players over time. This usually refers to the amount paid back over the long term, rather than short-term payouts. The RTP percentage can be helpful in understanding how likely it is that you will lose money while playing a game.

To calculate the RTP percentage, you need to know the expected return and the bet size. The expected return is simply the average payout of a game over time. The bet size is how much money you bet on each spin or round. Multiply the expected return by 100 and divide by the bet size to get the RTP percentage.

For example, if you are playing a slot machine with an expected return of 95 percent and you bet $1 per spin, then your RTP percentage would be 95 percent. If you are playing a game with an expected return of 97 percent and you bet $10 per spin, then your RTP percentage would be 97 percent.

You will be dealt two cards face up and five cards face down. You can now choose which of your five face down cards to keep in order to make the best hand possible. To keep a card, simply left click on it; to discard it and replace it with another, right click on it. Once you have made your choices, hit the Draw button and your two face up cards will be replaced with two new ones. If you have made a winning hand, your payout will be displayed in the Win box (above the chips).
