#  Blackjack Hoffman: How to make the most of him in your battletech game!

Blackjack Hoffman is one of the most popular and well-known characters in the Battletech universe. Many players want to use him in their games, but may not know how to make the most of him. This article will provide some tips on how to do just that.

First and foremost, Hoffman is a beast on the battlefield. With his massive amounts of armor and weapons, he can take down almost any opponent. However, he is also very expensive points-wise, so you need to make sure that you are using him effectively.

One way to do this is by using Hoffman as a bodyguard for your other units. His armor can soak up a lot of damage, allowing your other units to survive longer. Additionally, his weapons can easily take out enemy units, making him a valuable asset on the battlefield.

Another way to use Hoffman is by using him as a tank. By positioning him in front of your other units, you can prevent the enemy from getting too close. His armor and weapons will make short work of any unit that dares approach, allowing your other units to stay safe and damage the enemy from a distance.

Lastly, Hoffman can also be used as a support unit. By providing cover fire for your other units or by buffing them with his abilities, Hoffman can help them perform at their best. This can be especially helpful against tough opponents who may be difficult to take down conventionally.

In short, there are many ways to use Hoffman in your Battletech game. By using him effectively, you can give yourself a major advantage on the battlefield. So go out there and show those enemies who’s boss!
