#  Place your bets: Meadowlands Casino offers sports betting starting now!

The Meadowlands Casino in East Rutherford, NJ is now open for sports betting. This comes just in time for the NFL season, which kicks off on Thursday, September 6th.

Meadowlands has already taken thousands of bets on the upcoming season. Bettors can place their bets on individual games or various futures markets, including who will win the Super Bowl.

The Meadowlands Casino is operated by a partnership between Hard Rock International and SBGi (SugarHouse Gaming). SBGi also operates the SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia.

"We're excited to offer sports betting at the Meadowlands," said Rick Caruso, CEO of Hard Rock International. "Our first priority is always providing an exceptional customer experience and we are confident that our guests will enjoy this new amenity."

The casino is open from 10am to 2am daily. It has a 30,000-square-foot gaming floor with 1,600 slots and video poker machines, and 50 table games. There's also a race and sports book, where bettors can place their wagers.

Meadowlands joins a growing number of casinos in New Jersey that offer sports betting. Monmouth Park started taking bets on August 13th, while Ocean Resort Casino started last week. Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa and Caesars Atlantic City both started earlier this month.

#  Ready, set, bet: new sports betting options open at Meadowlands Casino

The Meadowlands Casino, in East Rutherford, New Jersey, just outside of New York City, has become the latest gambling destination to offer sports betting. The addition of sports betting at the casino came just in time for the start of the NFL season.

The casino is home to a number of different sporting events that gamblers can bet on, including professional and college football, basketball, baseball, and hockey. In addition to traditional bets on who will win or lose a game, the Meadowlands Casino also offers more exotic bets, such as whether or not a team will cover the point spread or how many points a team will win by.

The sports book at the Meadowlands Casino is operated by William Hill US. The company has been offering sports betting in Nevada since 1954 and was one of the first companies to offer legalized sports betting in New Jersey when it became available in June of this year.

Gamblers looking to place a bet at the Meadowlands Casino can do so either in person or online. In person, bettors can head over to the sports book and place their bets directly with an employee. Online, however, is where most of the action is taking place. Bettors can log onto the William Hill website and place their bets from their computer or mobile device.

The addition of sports betting at the Meadowlands Casino comes as no surprise given that New Jersey is one of only a few states that have legalized sports betting in recent years. In addition to New Jersey, Nevada and Delaware also allow sports betting, while Pennsylvania and West Virginia are expected to offer it soon.
