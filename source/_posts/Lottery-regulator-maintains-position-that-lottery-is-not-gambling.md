#  Lottery regulator maintains position that lottery is not gambling

Lottery regulator in the United Kingdom has come out and said that they do not believe that lottery is a form of gambling. This comes in the light of the fact that there has been an increased call for regulation of lotteries in the country. Lottery is often seen as a form of gambling, given that it involves betting on the likelihood of something happening. However, the regulator insists that this is not the case with lottery.

The regulator pointed to the fact that lottery is based on chance, whereas gambling is based on skill. In addition, gamble relies on players risking something they already have for a potential gain, whereas lottery players do not lose anything if they do not win. Finally, gamble tends to be much more expensive than lottery, with people placing bets ranging from a few pence to thousands of pounds.

While there may be an element of chance involved in lottery, it is by no means as high as in gambling. This is because lottery has fixed odds, meaning that players have a known chance of winning any prize. Gamble does not have fixed odds, which means that players can lose large sums of money very quickly if they are unlucky. For these reasons, the regulator believes that lottery should not be classified as gambling.

#  Attorney General won't rule out future legal action against online lotto operators

The Attorney General, George Brandis, has refused to rule out future legal action against online lotto operators, despite his department’s current investigation into the industry.

Sen. Brandis was asked at a Senate Estimates hearing last week if he would consider taking legal action against companies such as Lottoland and PlayLotto24.

"We are currently investigating the impact of these activities on the Australian lottery sector," he said. "I can't say any more than that."

Last year, the Western Australia government announced it was considering legal action against Lottoland over its operations in the state. The company is currently being sued by Tatts Group, the operator of the official Australian lottery.

Lottoland allows customers to bet on the outcomes of overseas lotteries, including those in the United States and Europe. The company says it offers customers a chance to win larger prizes than they would if they bought tickets in the official lottery.

Critics argue that Lottoland takes money away from state-run lotteries, and that its operations amount to gambling rather than betting.

#  Lotto not considered gambling by many states

Gambling, according to Merriam-Webster, is "to stake or risk money, property, or something of value on the outcome of a game, contest, or other event involving chance." When one purchases a lottery ticket, they are doing just that – staking money on an event involving chance. However, many states do not consider the lottery to be gambling.

How can this be? How can something that seems so clearly gambling not be considered as such by law? The answer lies in how each state defines gambling. In some states, like Oregon, only games of chance where the house has an edge are considered gambling. Since lotteries have odds of around 1 in 25 million of winning, they are not considered games of chance with an edge for the house. Other states, like Delaware and New Hampshire, look at whether or not the player has an opportunity to win money back. Because lottery tickets cannot be redeemed for cash in most cases (in contrast to casino slots or poker machines), these states do not consider lotteries to be gambling activities.

There are pros and cons to each definition. On one hand, it could be argued that lotteries are unfair because the house always wins in the long run. On the other hand, it could be argued that lotteries offer opportunities for people who would not ordinarily participate in gambling activities to try their luck at becoming rich.

Which side of the argument you fall on likely depends on your personal feelings about gambling. But whichever side you land on, it's hard to argue with the fact that state laws defining lotteries as something other than gambling have a significant impact on how much revenue these games generate.

#  Congressman calls for investigation into whether state lotteries are rigged

The recent news that a group of 11 coworkers in Illinois hit the same $5 million lottery jackpot has raised speculation that lotteries may be rigged. And now one U.S. congressman is calling for an investigation into whether state lotteries are fixed.

“Congress has a duty to investigate whether state lotteries are unfairly rigged against the average person,” said Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) in a statement on Wednesday. “Hardworking Americans who play the lottery deserve to know that the odds are fair, and that they have a chance to win without being taken advantage of by those running these games.”

The idea of lottery rigging isn’t new; there have been suspicions for years that some people may have inside information about winning numbers. But with the recent case in Illinois – where not only did co-workers hit the jackpot, but they also all purchased tickets from the same store – it seems to be gaining more attention.

In a statement, Illinois Lottery officials said that the winning ticket was a “complete coincidence” and that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing. They added that the store where the tickets were sold had been checked and found to be legitimate.

Rep. Cohen said he plans to introduce legislation called the “Lottery Fairness Act” which would require state lotteries to undergo regular audits and make results public.

#  Is the lotto a form of gambling? You be the judge

In some of the United States, it is legal to gamble in a state-run lottery. You buy a ticket for a certain set price, and if the numbers on your ticket match those chosen in the lottery, you win a prize. This may seem like a simple question, but there is actually some debate over whether or not lotteries are a form of gambling. Let's take a closer look at both sides of the argument.

Those who say that lotteries are gambling argue that the basic definition of gambling is "a game in which money or something else of value is risked on the outcome." They say that when you purchase a lottery ticket, you are risking money on the outcome – and therefore, lotteries are gambling games.

Others argue that lotteries are not gambling because there is no element of chance involved. They say that the only thing you are risking when you play the lottery is the price of your ticket, and that since you can choose your own numbers, there is no luck involved. Therefore, they say, lotteries are not gambling games.

So what do you think? Are lotteries a form of gambling? Or are they something else entirely? The answer isn't always clear-cut, but it's up to each individual to decide what they believe.
