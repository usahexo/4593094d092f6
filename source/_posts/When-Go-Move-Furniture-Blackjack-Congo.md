#  When Go Move Furniture Blackjack Congo

There isn't much to organizing beyond just grabbing items and putting them where they go, is there? Not according to Marie Kondo, the guru of decluttering whose book "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up" has sold millions of copies worldwide. To keep your house in order, Kondo recommends a specific approach to folding clothes and arranging belongings that she calls the KonMari Method.

If you're looking to tidy up your home using the KonMari Method, follow these tips.

1. Sort your belongings into categories: clothing, books, papers, miscellaneous items, and sentimental objects.

2. Start with clothing. Pick up one item at a time and ask yourself if it brings you joy. If it doesn't, discard it.

3. Follow the same process for books, papers, miscellaneous items, and sentimental objects. Keep only those items that bring you joy.

4. Place folded clothes in drawers vertically so you can see what's on top. Don't cram them in or they'll be difficult to remove.

5. Hang shirts and dresses on hangers with the hook pointing left so the fabric doesn't stretch out over time. use thinning clips to keep multiple garments together on one hanger.

6 . Store books on shelves with the spines facing out so you can see the titles at a glance. Group related titles together for easier browsing.

7 . Use boxes or baskets to store miscellaneous items instead of letting them clutter up your surfaces. Label containers for easy identification of their contents.

8 . Place sentimental objects in a special place where you can see and enjoy them often. A simple box or jar will do for smaller items; for larger objects, find a special display spot in your home..

#  Involuntary Migration and the State in the Congo

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is a country rich in natural resources, making it a target for business interests from around the world. However, this wealth has not translated into benefits for the Congolese people. The country is ranked among the poorest in the world, with over 60% of the population living below the poverty line. In addition, DRC is plagued by political instability and conflict. This has led to large-scale displacement of people within and outside of the country.

One of the main drivers of displacement in DRC is involuntary migration. This occurs when people are forced to flee their homes due to conflict, violence or persecution. As a result of the ongoing conflict in DRC, millions of people have been forced to flee their homes and seek refuge elsewhere. Many have sought asylum in neighbouring countries such as Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, while others have attempted to cross into Europe or South Africa.

The impact of involuntary migration on individuals and communities can be devastating. People who are forced to flee their homes often lose everything they own, including their homes and livelihoods. They may also face dangers such as sexual violence and exploitation, or being caught up in fighting between armed groups. Furthermore, refugees often have limited access to essential services such as healthcare and education. This can have a negative impact on their physical and mental health, as well as on their future prospects.

In addition to its human cost, involuntary migration also has a significant economic impact on DRC. It is estimated that each year there is a loss of $2 billion due to displacement – this includes lost revenue from taxes, reduced trade and investment opportunities, and costs associated with providing humanitarian assistance.

The international community has a responsibility to protect civilians affected by conflict and violence, including those who are displaced. However, many countries are failing to meet this responsibility. In DRC specifically, there has been a lack of political will on the part of both national and international actors to address the root causes of displacement. This has resulted in insufficient funding for humanitarian assistance programmes and inadequate support for refugees who have fled to neighbouring countries.

There is an urgent need for all stakeholders – including governments, UN agencies and civil society organisations – to work together towards finding long-term solutions to displacement in DRC. This includes addressing the root causes of conflict and violence, as well as ensuring that refugees receive adequate protection and support.

#  The Dynamics of Forced Migration from the Congo

The ongoing humanitarian crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has forced millions of people to flee their homes in search of safety and security. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are now more than 4 million Congolese refugees living in neighboring countries, making it the world’s largest refugee crisis.

While many refugees have fled to neighboring countries such as Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi, an increasing number are making their way to Europe. In fact, the number of Congolese asylum seekers in Europe has more than doubled over the past five years, reaching a total of nearly 70,000 in 2018.

Why are so many Congolese fleeing their home country?

There are many factors driving displacement from the DRC. The ongoing conflict and violence is a major factor, with civilians often targeted by armed groups. Gang violence and sexual violence are also common, forcing women and girls to flee for safety.

Additionally, the DRC is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a high rate of maternal and child mortality. More than 60% of the population lives below the poverty line, making it difficult for people to afford basic essentials such as food and shelter.

What is being done to help Congolese refugees?

The UNHCR and other humanitarian organizations are working tirelessly to provide assistance to Congolese refugees living in exile. They provide essential items such as food, shelter, water, and health care, as well as educational and vocational training programs.

However, much more needs to be done to address the root causes of displacement from the DRC. The international community must continue to pressure all parties involved in the conflict to respect human rights and end the violence. Additionally, more must be done to improve conditions in the DRC so that people can safely return home when it is safe to do so.

#  Refugees in the Congo: The Plight of Internally Displaced Persons

Since the beginning of the Congolese civil war in 1997, millions of people have been displaced. The conflict has claimed the lives of 5.4 million people, making it the deadliest conflict since World War II. Of the total population of Congo, 10 percent are IDPs.

The majority of IDPs in Congo are from the eastern provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu. These provinces have been plagued by violence and insecurity for decades, as militias and rebel groups battle for control of territory and natural resources.

Many IDPs in Congo live in deplorable conditions, with little access to basic services or humanitarian assistance. They are often forced to flee their homes multiple times, as clashes between armed groups continue to erupt.

In North Kivu, more than 1.1 million people are displaced, including over 460,000 children. More than half of all displaced children in North Kivu are not enrolled in school. In South Kivu, 940,000 people are displaced, including almost 400,000 children. Nearly 60 percent of all displaced children in South Kivu are not enrolled in school.

Refugees in Congo suffer from a wide range of protection threats, including gender-based violence and recruitment into armed groups. Many women and girls are subjected to sexual abuse and exploitation by armed groups and militia members. Boys are often forcibly recruited into armed groups, where they often experience abuse and violence.

The UN Security Council recently adopted resolution 2421 on the protection of civilians in Congo. The resolution calls for increased efforts to protect civilians from violence and abuses by armed groups and the government security forces. It also calls for increased humanitarian assistance to IDPs and refugees in Congo.

#  The Humanitarian Crisis in the Congo

For over two decades, the Democratic Republic of Congo has been embroiled in a humanitarian crisis. Poverty, conflict and instability have resulted in the death of millions of people and displacement of millions more. The situation in the Congo is one of the worst in the world, with little prospect for improvement in the near future.

Since 1996, nearly 8 million people have died as a direct result of the conflict in the Congo. This number does not include those who have died from preventable diseases or malnutrition. More than 4 million people have been displaced, many of whom are living in dire conditions.

The humanitarian crisis in the Congo is a complex one, with multiple factors contributing to it. Poverty is a major issue, as is lack of infrastructure and access to basic services. The ongoing conflict has also contributed to the humanitarian crisis, with violence and rape being widespread. Corruption is also rampant in the Congo, contributing to the instability and poverty.

The international community has failed the people of the Congo for years, with very little being done to address the crisis. However, there are some organisations doing excellent work on the ground, helping those who are most vulnerable. There is hope that things will improve in the future, but much depends on the political situation in the country.
