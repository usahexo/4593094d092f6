<p>If you’re like most base slot players, you’re always looking for ways to rack up more points and climb the leaderboard. Well, look no further! Here are some tips to help you score big in base slots:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use your powerups!</li>
</ol>
<p>Your powerups are an essential part of your arsenal, so be sure to use them wisely. Some powerups are more powerful than others, so try to mix and match them to create the most effective combo.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Play smart</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t go all out right from the start - take your time and figure out what works best for you. There’s no point in risking all your points on a single spin if it doesn’t payoff. Instead, try building up your point total gradually until you feel confident enough to make a bigger bet.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Stay focused</li>
</ol>
<p>It can be tempting to chat with other players or check out other games while you’re playing, but this can often lead to costly mistakes. Focus on the game at hand and don’t let anything distract you from the task at hand.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Keep track of your progress</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the best ways to improve your gameplay is to keep track of your progress. Record your wins and losses so that you can identify your strengths and weaknesses. This will help you determine which strategies work best for you and give you something to aim for.</p>

        <h1 id="How-to-dress-for-a-casino-visit"><a href="#How-to-dress-for-a-casino-visit" class="headerlink" title="How to dress for a casino visit"></a>How to dress for a casino visit</h1><p>When you’re dressing for a casino visit, you want to make sure you look your best. After all, this is a place where you want to make a good impression. Here are some tips on what to wear:</p>
<p>For men, it’s generally best to wear a suit or at least some slacks and a dress shirt. Make sure your clothing is neat and clean, and avoid wearing too much cologne.</p>
<p>For women, it’s also generally best to dress up.Try wearing a dress or skirt and blouse, or jeans with a nice shirt or blazer. Avoid wearing too much jewelry or makeup, as both can be distracting.</p>
<p>Of course, there are always exceptions to these rules. If you’re going to a more casual casino such as one in Las Vegas, then it’s OK to dress more casually. But if you’re going to a high-class casino in Atlantic City or elsewhere, then it’s best to err on the side of caution and dress up.</p>
<p>No matter what you wear, make sure you feel comfortable in your clothes. You don’t want them to be tight or restrictive, as that will just make you uncomfortable and probably won’t help your game either!</p>
<h1 id="What-to-wear-when-gambling"><a href="#What-to-wear-when-gambling" class="headerlink" title="What to wear when gambling"></a>What to wear when gambling</h1><p>There is no one definitive answer to the question of what to wear when gambling, but there are a few key things to remember.</p>
<p>First and foremost, dress comfortably. You’ll be sitting in one spot for a while, so you don’t want anything too restrictive or uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Casual, comfortable clothing is generally the way to go. That doesn’t mean you can’t dress up a bit if you feel like it - just be sure not to overdo it. You don’t want to be too flashy and draw attention to yourself, as that could potentially lead to some unwanted scrutiny from other casino-goers.</p>
<p>Some people also recommend dressing in colours that make you feel good. This might be something that varies from person to person, so experiment a bit and see what works best for you. Black is generally seen as a safe option, but again, it’s up to you.</p>
<p>In terms of accessories, keep it minimal. You don’t want to have anything hanging off your body or swinging around that could get caught in something and cause a problem. A small bag or purse is probably the best option, and leave the jewellery at home. Chances are you won’t need it while gambling anyway.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the best advice is to wear whatever makes you feel comfortable. If you’re feeling good in what you’re wearing, then that’s half the battle won already. So go with your gut instinct and have fun!</p>
<h1 id="Casino-dress-code-What-you-need-to-know"><a href="#Casino-dress-code-What-you-need-to-know" class="headerlink" title="Casino dress code: What you need to know"></a>Casino dress code: What you need to know</h1><p>Casinos have dress codes in place to ensure that all guests are dressed in an appropriate manner. This helps to create a more elegant and sophisticated atmosphere in the casino. </p>
<p>Most casinos have a general dress code that requires guests to be dressed in “smart casual” attire. This means that you should wear clothing that is neat and tidy, but not too formal. For men, this typically includes collared shirts, dress pants, and dress shoes. Women can wear skirts, blouses, dresses, or slacks. It is also generally acceptable to wear denim jeans and a T-shirt as long as they are neat and tidy. </p>
<p>Some casinos also have specific dress codes that are more restrictive. For example, some may require men to wear jackets and ties or women to wear cocktail dresses. If you are not sure what the dress code is for a particular casino, it is best to call and ask before you arrive. </p>
<p>In addition to dressing appropriately, it is also important to act appropriately while in a casino. That means no loud talking, no gambling if you are underage, and no using offensive language. Casino staff will usually ask guests who are not following the rules to leave the premises. </p>
<p>So if you’re planning on visiting a casino in the near future, be sure to brush up on your casino dress code etiquette!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-dress-for-success-at-the-casino"><a href="#How-to-dress-for-success-at-the-casino" class="headerlink" title="How to dress for success at the casino"></a>How to dress for success at the casino</h1><p>No matter what casino you visit, or what game you choose to play, there are a few key things to always keep in mind when dressing for a night at the casino. You want to make sure you feel comfortable, confident, and stylish – and most importantly, that you don’t stand out too much.</p>
<p>When it comes to clothing, think about wearing neutral colors. Black is always a good choice, but shades of grey, navy, and beige are also versatile and will match most of the games room’s decor. Avoid wearing anything too busy or eye-catching; you don’t want your attire to be the focus of attention instead of your skills at the table.</p>
<p>It’s also important to dress appropriately for the atmosphere of the casino. If you’re going to a more formal establishment, wear a cocktail dress or suit; if it’s more laid back, jeans and a nice top will do. And whatever you do, make sure your shoes are comfortable – you may be spending a lot of time on your feet!</p>
<p>Of course, no matter how great your outfit is, it won’t mean anything if you don’t feel like yourself in it. So don’t be afraid to experiment until you find something that makes you feel confident and comfortable – after all, that’s what matters most at the casino.</p>
<h1 id="Dressing-for-a-casino-What-to-wear-and-what-to-avoid"><a href="#Dressing-for-a-casino-What-to-wear-and-what-to-avoid" class="headerlink" title="Dressing for a casino: What to wear and what to avoid"></a>Dressing for a casino: What to wear and what to avoid</h1><p>When it comes to casinos, there are some general do’s and don’ts when it comes to what to wear. Here is a rundown of the basics:</p>
<p>DO dress in layers. The temperature inside a casino can vary quite a bit, so it’s best to dress in layers so you can adjust as needed.</p>
<p>DON’T wear anything too revealing. This should go without saying, but it’s best to avoid wearing shorts, tank tops, or any other clothing that is too revealing. You want to look like you’re there to gamble, not party.</p>
<p>DO dress comfortably. This is especially important if you plan on spending an extended amount of time at the casino. You want to be comfortable enough to move around easily and not feel cramped up.</p>
<p>DON’T wear shoes that are uncomfortable or difficult to walk in. Like with clothing, you want to make sure your shoes are comfortable so you can move around easily. High heels are generally not a good idea when gambling, as they can be difficult to walk in and you may end up having to take them off mid-session if they start bothering you.</p>
<p>DO bring extra money. When gambling, it’s always a good idea to have extra money on hand in case you lose what you started with. This will help minimize the impact of any losses and ensure that you still have some fun while gambling.</p>
<p>DON’T drink or gamble excessively. It goes without saying that you should avoid drinking or gambling excessively while at the casino – both can lead to costly mistakes. Try to keep your drinking and gambling under control so that you stay safe and don’t lose too much money.</p>

Unfortunately, many people believe that craps is a game of pure chance, and they are hesitant to try it because they think they will never win. However, if you follow these three tips, you can increase your chances of winning when playing craps at the casino.</p>
<p>Tip #1: Learn The Game</p>
<p>The first step to winning at craps is to learn how to play the game. This may seem like an obvious tip, but many people dive in without taking the time to learn the basics. Craps is a relatively simple game once you understand the basic rules. However, there are a few different bets you can make, and it can be confusing for beginners. That’s why it’s important to take some time to learn the game before hitting the casino. There are plenty of online resources available that can teach you how to play craps.</p>
<p>Tip #2: Don’t Bet Too Much</p>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes new players make is betting too much money on each bet. When you’re playing craps at a casino, it’s easy to get caught up in the excitement and start betting bigger and bigger amounts. However, this can quickly lead to losses if you’re not lucky. It’s a better strategy to start with smaller bets and increase your stakes slowly as you gain more experience and confidence. This will help ensure that you don’t lose too much money if Lady Luck isn’t on your side.</p>
<p>Tip #3: Choose The Right Bets</p>
<p>Not all bets are created equal in craps. Some bets offer better odds than others, so it pays to do your homework before placing any bets. The best bets are those that involve betting on the Pass or Don’t Pass line. These bets have even odds (1:1), which means that you have a 50% chance of winning each bet. There are also other good bets options such as betting on specific numbers or putting together certain types of wagers known as “combos”. By picking wisely and avoiding risky bets, you can give yourself a better chance at winning at craps.</p>

It is also one of the most complex, which can make it difficult for beginners to understand and play correctly. However, with a bit of practice and some tips from the pros, you can learn how to play craps like a pro!</p>
<h2 id="The-Basics"><a href="#The-Basics" class="headerlink" title="The Basics"></a>The Basics</h2><p> Craps is a game that involves betting on the outcome of rolling two dice. There are many different bets you can make, and the odds vary depending on the bet. In order to win money at craps, you need to predict the right number that will be rolled.</p>
<p>The basic rules of craps are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Players place their bets on the table before the dice are rolled.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The player who is rolling the dice is called the shooter.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The shooter rolls two dice and tries to roll a 7 or an 11 (a natural) to win immediately. If any other number is rolled, that becomes the point number.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The shooter continues rolling until they either roll their point number again (a winning roll), or else roll a 7 (a losing roll).</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the shooter rolls their point number, players who have placed bets on that number win. If they roll a 7 instead, players who have bet on that number lose.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Different-Types-of-Bets-in-Craps"><a href="#Different-Types-of-Bets-in-Craps" class="headerlink" title="Different Types of Bets in Craps"></a>Different Types of Bets in Craps</h2><p>There are many different types of bets you can place in craps, some with better odds than others. Here are some of the most common bets:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pass Line Bet – This is the simplest bet in craps, and also has the best odds. You simply bet that the shooter will roll a 7 or an 11 on their next roll. If they do, you win; if not, you lose your bet. This bet pays even money when it wins.</li>
<li>Come Bet – This is similar to a pass line bet, but can be made after the point number has been established. You’re betting that the shooter will roll a 7 or an 11 on their next roll; if they do so, you win; if not, you lose your bet just like with a pass line bet. 3-2 odds are paid on come bets when they win.  3-way Bet - Also known as “hop bets”, these are wagers placed on specific combinations of numbers shown as either singles or doubles on the dice layout . For example, you might wager $10 on “2 &amp; 12” which would pay out $30 if it won . Unlike most other bets in craps , hop bets can be made at any time during a game . Prop Bets - These are special wagers offered by casinos which don’t fit into any of the categories listed above . Examples might include betting on whether both dice will show same face value , whether snake eyes (two ones) will be rolled , and so forth . Generally speaking , prop bets offer worse odds than other options available at the table .  4 . Place Bets - These allow players to wager money on specific numbers which may not be currently being offered by Pass or Come lines . For instance , if there are no Chips situated alongside The Point box then Players cannot place wagers at those Points BUT Players CAN still PLACE Wagers ON 6 &amp; 8 BOXES AS LONG AS THE POINT NUMBER IS NOT A 6 OR 8 .  5 . Hard Way Bets - As implied by the name , these are wagers placed on whether doubles ( 2-2 , 3-3 , etc .) will be rolled as doubles , rather than as two separate numbers . For example , a $10 Hard Way Bet on 4 would pay out $200 if it won – provided that four exactly fours were rolled ( 2-2-2-3 ) rather than two fours being rolled separately ( 1-3-4-6 ).  6 . Double Odds Bets - This allows players to increase their original wager amount by double when making certain types of proposition or pass line bets . So for example if someone originally wagered $10 and then chose to go double odds this would now become a $20 wager … but would also entitle them to twice whatever they won provided they eventually won said bet amount back !</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Wanna-Win-at-Craps-Follow-These-Simple-Tips…"><a href="#Wanna-Win-at-Craps-Follow-These-Simple-Tips…" class="headerlink" title="Wanna Win at Craps? Follow These Simple Tips…"></a>Wanna Win at Craps? Follow These Simple Tips…</h1><p> Craps is one of the most popular casino games in the world and it can be a lot of fun to play, but if you want to have a chance of winning then you need to follow some simple tips.</p>
<p>#1: Don’t place bets on the Field</p>
<p>The Field bet is one of the worst bets that you can make in craps, so if you want to give yourself the best chance of winning then stay away from it. The house edge on this bet is a whopping 7.27%, so it’s definitely not worth your money.</p>
<p>#2: Stick to the Pass Line</p>
<p>The Pass Line bet is one of the best bets that you can make in craps, so it’s definitely worth sticking to this bet if you want to have a chance of winning. The house edge on this bet is just 1.41%, so it’s much better than the Field bet.</p>
<p>#3: Avoid Odds Bets</p>
<p>Odds bets are also a bad idea, as they have a house edge of over 10%. So if you want to give yourself the best chance of winning, then you should avoid making odds bets.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Maximize-Your-Chances-of-Winning-at-Craps"><a href="#How-to-Maximize-Your-Chances-of-Winning-at-Craps" class="headerlink" title="How to Maximize Your Chances of Winning at Craps"></a>How to Maximize Your Chances of Winning at Craps</h1><p>In order to maximize your chances of winning money at craps, you need to understand the game, the different bets you can make, and how the odds work.</p>
<p>The basic goal of craps is to roll a certain number (7 or 11) before rolling a 2, 3, or 12. This is called a “natural” and results in an instant win for the player. If you don’t roll a natural, the dice are passed to the next player and they continue rolling until either a natural is rolled or they bust (roll a 2, 3, or 12 on their first roll).</p>
<p>The different bets you can make at craps are:</p>
<p>Pass Line: This is the most basic bet in craps and simply means betting that the shooter will roll a 7 or 11 on their next roll. If they do not roll a 7 or 11, you lose your bet.</p>
<p>Don’t Pass Line: This is the opposite of the Pass Line bet and means betting that the shooter will roll a 2, 3, or 12 on their next roll. If they do not roll a 2, 3, or 12, you win your bet.</p>
<p>Come: This bet is similar to the Pass Line bet, but can be made after the point has been established. This means that if you don’t like the current run of numbers being rolled, you can make this bet instead and have another chance at winning.</p>
<p>Don’t Come: The opposite of the Come bet, this means betting that the next number rolled will be a 7. If it’s not a 7, you lose your bet.</p>
<p>Pass Odds: After making a Pass Line bet, you can also make an odds bet which gives you even better odds of winning. This is simply a second wager placed behind your original Pass Line bet that pays out based on the true odds of rolling a 7 or 11 on the next roll (2&#x2F;1).</p>
<p>Don’t Pass Odds: The opposite of Pass Odds, this means making a second wager after placing a Don’t Pass Line bet that pays out based on the true odds of rolling a 2, 3, or 12 on the next roll (3&#x2F;2).</p>
<p>There are also other more complex bets available at craps which offer even better odds such as Place Bets and Field Bets - but these are beyond the scope of this article. Once you understand how to make these basic bets correctly however, they form the foundation for learning how to play craps successfully.</p>
<h1 id="The-One-Secret-to-Winning-at-Craps-Every-Time"><a href="#The-One-Secret-to-Winning-at-Craps-Every-Time" class="headerlink" title="The One Secret to Winning at Craps Every Time"></a>The One Secret to Winning at Craps Every Time</h1><p>There is one secret to winning at craps every time - and that is to use a betting strategy known as the Martingale system.</p>
<p>This system is simple to use, and it can help you to win more money when you are playing craps. Here’s how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Start by placing a small bet on the pass line.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you lose, then double your bet for the next round.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you lose again, then double your bet once more.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you win, then start over with a small bet on the pass line.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By using this system, you will ensure that you always have a chance to win your money back - and you may even be able to make a profit in the process!</p>

The Dodgers are the favorites, but there are plenty of teams that could give them a run for their money. What are the odds of each team winning the division?</p>
<p>The Dodgers have the best odds of winning the division, at 3-1. They are followed by the Giants and Rockies, who have odds of 5-1 and 7-1, respectively. The Padres have the longest odds of winning the division, at 25-1.</p>
<p>So what do these odds mean? They indicate how likely each team is to win the NL West. The Dodgers are three times as likely to win the division as the Padres are.</p>
<p>Some sportsbooks also offer betting on who will win the NL West. If you think one of the other teams has a good chance of winning, you can place a bet on them and potentially earn some money.</p>
<p>The NL West is always a hotly contested division, and this year is no exception. There are plenty of good teams vying for first place, so it should be an exciting race to watch.</p>
<h1 id="Who-is-the-favorite-to-win-the-NL-West"><a href="#Who-is-the-favorite-to-win-the-NL-West" class="headerlink" title="Who is the favorite to win the NL West?"></a>Who is the favorite to win the NL West?</h1><p>The Dodgers are the clear front runners to win the NL West. They boast the best record in baseball and have some of the most talented players in the league. However, there is a lot of parity in the NL West this year and no team can be counted out.</p>
<p>The Diamondbacks have been one of the surprise teams in baseball this year. They currently sit in second place in the division and have shown they are capable of competing with the Dodgers. The Giants are always tough to beat and will be looking to make a playoff run this year. The Rockies and Padres are both rebuilding teams, but they both have some talented young players that could surprise people.</p>
<p>In the end, I think the Dodgers will win the NL West. They are the best team in baseball right now and have too much talent for anyone to compete with them.</p>
<h1 id="Who-are-the-contenders-for-the-NL-West"><a href="#Who-are-the-contenders-for-the-NL-West" class="headerlink" title="Who are the contenders for the NL West?"></a>Who are the contenders for the NL West?</h1><p>This year’s National League West is up for grabs. The Dodgers, Rockies, Diamondbacks, Giants, and Padres are all in the running.</p>
<p>The Dodgers are the favorites to win the division. They have a strong lineup and a solid rotation. Clayton Kershaw and Kenley Jansen are among the best players in the league.</p>
<p>The Rockies are also contenders. They have an explosive offense and a young pitching staff. Charlie Blackmon and Nolan Arenado are two of the best players in the division.</p>
<p>The Diamondbacks are dark horses in the race. They have a solid lineup and some of the best starting pitching in the league. Zack Greinke and Robbie Ray are two of their biggest strengths.</p>
<p>The Giants are rebuilding this year and aren’t expected to do well. However, they still have some talented players on their roster, such as Buster Posey and Madison Bumgarner.</p>
<p>The Padres are at the bottom of the divisional standings. They have a weak lineup and inexperienced pitching staff.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-key-players-in-the-NL-West"><a href="#What-are-the-key-players-in-the-NL-West" class="headerlink" title="What are the key players in the NL West?"></a>What are the key players in the NL West?</h1><p>The National League West is home to some of the biggest names in baseball. The Los Angeles Dodgers, Colorado Rockies, Arizona Diamondbacks, and San Diego Padres are all vying for a spot in the playoffs this year. So, who are the key players to watch in this division?</p>
<p>The Dodgers are led by Clayton Kershaw, one of the best pitchers in baseball. He is joined by other star players such as Justin Turner and Corey Seager. The Rockies are led by Nolan Arenado and Charlie Blackmon, who are both batting over .300 this season. The Diamondbacks are led by Paul Goldschmidt, who is batting .321 with 19 homers and 58 RBIs this season. The Padres are led by Wil Myers, who is batting .276 with 20 homers and 67 RBIs this season.</p>
<p>These players are sure to provide some exciting baseball action in the NL West this season. So, be sure to watch for them as your favorite team competes for a playoff spot!</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-most-important-games-in-the-NL-West"><a href="#What-are-the-most-important-games-in-the-NL-West" class="headerlink" title="What are the most important games in the NL West?"></a>What are the most important games in the NL West?</h1><p>There are several important games in the NL West, but some seem to stand out more than others.</p>
<p>The Dodgers and Giants have always been rivals, and their games are always important. They have met in the playoffs a few times, and the rivalry is sure to continue this year.</p>
<p>The Diamondbacks also had a strong season last year, and they are sure to give the Dodgers and Giants a run for their money. Their games will be exciting to watch.</p>
<p>And finally, there are the Padres. They are not expected to do very well this year, but they could always surprise us. So their games will also be worth watching.</p>

<h1 id="How-do-I-play"><a href="#How-do-I-play" class="headerlink" title="How do I play?"></a>How do I play?</h1><p>To play, each player selects a disc color and takes up a position on their end of the field. The disc is then thrown toward the other team’s goal. If a player catches the disc, they can either run with it or throw it to a teammate. If they are tackled before they can throw it, possession of the disc changes hands. If a player throws the disc into the other team’s goal, they score a point and possession changes hands. The game is played in two halves, and the team with the most points at the end of the game wins.</p>

<h1 id="What-are-the-bonus-features"><a href="#What-are-the-bonus-features" class="headerlink" title="What are the bonus features?"></a>What are the bonus features?</h1><p>Bonus features are the additional benefits that come with a product or service. They can be anything from free shipping to a discount on your next purchase.</p>
<p>When it comes to bonus features, there are three main things to keep in mind: what’s being offered, how you can redeem it, and any restrictions that may apply.</p>
<p>Firstly, it’s important to know what’s being offered. This could be a discount on your next purchase, free shipping, or even a free gift. Secondly, you need to know how you can redeem it. This typically involves entering a promo code at checkout or availing of the offer on the seller’s website. Finally, there may be some restrictions that apply. For example, you may only be able to use the offer once or it may only be available for a certain period of time.</p>
<p>It’s important to read the terms and conditions of any bonus offer before you redeem it. This will help ensure that you get the most value out of the offer and avoid any surprises down the road.</p>

<h1 id="What-are-the-symbols-in-the-game"><a href="#What-are-the-symbols-in-the-game" class="headerlink" title="What are the symbols in the game?"></a>What are the symbols in the game?</h1><p>In the popular game “Pokemon Go,” there are a variety of symbols that players need to be aware of in order to play the game successfully. Some of these symbols are common, others are more specific to particular areas or aspects of the game. Here is a list of some of the most important symbols players need to know about:</p>
<p>The Pokeball is the most common symbol in the game and appears everywhere. It is used to catch Pokemon and store them in your inventory.</p>
<p>The Gym is another common symbol and indicates a place where players can battle other Pokemon trainers for control of the Gym.</p>
<p>The stop sign is an important symbol that means players need to stop and cannot continue walking until they have interacted with it. This often pops up as an obstacle in the game or when travelling between different areas.</p>
<p>The Professor Willow icon is an important one that signals a tutorial message or event is about to take place.</p>
<p>The footprints icon indicates how close nearby wild Pokemon are, with three footprints meaning they’re further away and one footprint meaning they’re close by.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-RTP-percentage-of-the-game"><a href="#What-is-the-RTP-percentage-of-the-game" class="headerlink" title="What is the RTP percentage of the game?"></a>What is the RTP percentage of the game?</h1><p>The RTP percentage of a game is the percentage of money that is paid back to players over time. This usually refers to the amount paid back over the long term, rather than short-term payouts. The RTP percentage can be helpful in understanding how likely it is that you will lose money while playing a game.</p>
<p>To calculate the RTP percentage, you need to know the expected return and the bet size. The expected return is simply the average payout of a game over time. The bet size is how much money you bet on each spin or round. Multiply the expected return by 100 and divide by the bet size to get the RTP percentage.</p>
<p>For example, if you are playing a slot machine with an expected return of 95 percent and you bet $1 per spin, then your RTP percentage would be 95 percent. If you are playing a game with an expected return of 97 percent and you bet $10 per spin, then your RTP percentage would be 97 percent.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-I-play-Wild-Jack-Remastered"><a href="#How-do-I-play-Wild-Jack-Remastered" class="headerlink" title="How do I play Wild Jack Remastered?"></a>How do I play Wild Jack Remastered?</h1><p>If you’ve never played a video poker game before, don’t worry – Wild Jack offers an easy-to-follow tutorial to get you started. In brief, the aim of the game is to make the best five-card hand possible from the seven cards you are dealt. The payout for each winning hand is displayed in the table below:</p>
<p>Hand Payout</p>
<p>Royal Flush 1000 x bet amount<br>Straight Flush 250 x bet amountFour of a Kind 125 x bet amountFull House 50 x bet amountFlush 25 x bet amountStraight 10 x bet amountThree of a Kind 3 x bet amountTwo Pair 2 x bet amountJack or Better 1x bet amount</p>
<p>To start, select your stake by clicking on one of the chips at the bottom of the screen. You can then click on the Deal button to receive your seven cards. You will be dealt two cards face up and five cards face down. You can now choose which of your five face down cards to keep in order to make the best hand possible. To keep a card, simply left click on it; to discard it and replace it with another, right click on it. Once you have made your choices, hit the Draw button and your two face up cards will be replaced with two new ones. If you have made a winning hand, your payout will be displayed in the Win box (above the chips).</p>
<p>To help familiarize yourself with the different hands, we’ve compiled a list of some of the most common ones below:</p>
<p>Royal Flush – an ace, king, queen, jack and ten all of the same suit<br>Straight Flush – five consecutive cards all of the same suit (e.g. ace, 2, 3, 4, 5)Four of a Kind – four cards of the same rank (e.g. four kings)Full House – three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank (e.g. three queens and two sixes)Flush – five cards all of the same suit (but not necessarily consecutive)Straight – five consecutive cards not all of the same suitThree of a Kind – three cards of the same rankTwo Pair – two different pairs (e.g. two queens and two kings)Jack or Better – any hand that contains at least one jack or better ranking</p>
