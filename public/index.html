        <h1 id="Who-is-Eritrea1111"><a href="#Who-is-Eritrea1111" class="headerlink" title="Who is Eritrea1111?"></a>Who is Eritrea1111?</h1><p>Eritrea1111 is an anonymous Twitter account that has shot to prominence in the past year for its wry and incisive commentary on current events. The author’s identity is unknown, but their tweets have been praised for their insight, humor, and boldness.</p>
<p>Some of Eritrea1111’s best tweets include:</p>
<p>-“The Arab Spring was a conservative revolution. The young people who toppled the dictators were fascists, not liberals.”</p>
<p>-“In any other country, a 71% approval rating would be considered a ringing endorsement. But in America, it means Trump is underwater.”</p>
<p>-“Police shootings are a problem because they’re evidence that the criminal justice system is racist. If the police only killed white people, the problem would disappear.”</p>
<p>-“Twitter is proof that our opinions are shaped by people we’ve never heard of.”</p>
<h1 id="Do-you-think-online-gambling-would-be-a-good-idea-for-Eritrea"><a href="#Do-you-think-online-gambling-would-be-a-good-idea-for-Eritrea" class="headerlink" title="Do you think online gambling would be a good idea for Eritrea?"></a>Do you think online gambling would be a good idea for Eritrea?</h1><p>It’s no secret that Eritrea is in a tough situation. The country is struggling with high levels of poverty and a lack of basic services. Nearly half of the population is without access to essential health services, and more than two-thirds live in poverty.</p>
<p>So it might come as a surprise that some Eritreans are advocating for online gambling as a way to improve the country’s economy.</p>
<p>Gambling is big business, and it’s estimated that worldwide revenues from gambling will reach $465 billion by 2020. So it’s not hard to see why some people think that online gambling could be a good idea for Eritrea.</p>
<p>There are certainly some benefits to online gambling. It can create jobs and generate tax revenue. It can also help attract tourists and create opportunities for businesses, both in the gambling industry and in other sectors.</p>
<p>But there are also some risks associated with gambling. Gambling can be addictive, and it can lead to financial instability and criminal activity. There is also the risk that gambling will contribute to the spread of corruption and organized crime in Eritrea.</p>
<p>So should Eritrea legalize online gambling? That’s a difficult question to answer. On the one hand, there are clear benefits to online gambling. On the other hand, there are also risks that need to be taken into account. Ultimately, it will be up to the people of Eritrea to decide whether or not they want online gambling in their country</p>

<h1 id="Why-did-Hoffman-break-away-from-Africa"><a href="#Why-did-Hoffman-break-away-from-Africa" class="headerlink" title="Why did Hoffman break away from Africa?"></a>Why did Hoffman break away from Africa?</h1><p>For centuries, Africa has been known as the “dark continent.” But why?</p>
<p>One reason is that, until recently, much of Africa has been shrouded in darkness. According to the International Energy Agency, in 2012, only 33% of Sub-Saharan Africa had access to electricity. This compares to 99% in North America and Europe.</p>
<p>Another reason is that many African countries are plagued by government corruption, poverty, and violence. For example, in 2011, the United Nations ranked Congo as the world’s least developed country. And in 2017, the World Bank rated South Sudan as having the world’s sixth highest infant mortality rate.</p>
<p>But all this is starting to change. In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in investment in Africa’s infrastructure. For example, between 2007 and 2015, China invested $195 billion in Africa. And because of this investment, access to electricity across Africa has increased to 47%.</p>
<p>This increased investment is due, in part, to the success of African entrepreneurs. Over the past decade, African startups have received over $1 billion in venture capital funding. This is more than triple the amount raised between 2000 and 2009.</p>
<p>And this increased investment is starting to pay off. In 2017, African economies grew by 3%. This was faster than any other region in the world. And it looks like this trend will continue. The International Monetary Fund expects African economies to grow by 5% this year and 6% next year.</p>
<p>So what’s driving this growth? One reason is that many African countries have embraced technology. For example, Kenya has one of the most developed banking systems in Africa. And Nigeria has one of the most active mobile phone markets on the continent.</p>
<p>Another reason is that many African countries are now open for business. In recent years, a number of African countries have made it easier to do business there. For example, Rwanda reduced its corporate tax rate from 30% to 20%. And Ethiopia eliminated all import duties on goods from neighboring countries.</p>
<p>Finally, another reason for Africa’s growth is that its population is young and growing fast. Over 60% of Africans are younger than 25 years old. And by 2050, Africa will be home to 1 billion people - more than double its current population size.</p>

        <h1 id="What-are-the-20-moral-stories"><a href="#What-are-the-20-moral-stories" class="headerlink" title="What are the 20 moral stories?"></a>What are the 20 moral stories?</h1><p>Moral stories are a powerful way to ingrain ethical values in people of all ages. Many cultures have traditional moral stories that have been passed down for generations. Here are 20 of the most popular moral stories:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Tortoise and the Hare</li>
</ol>
<p>This is one of the best-known moral stories. It teaches the lesson that slow and steady wins the race.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The Boy who Cried Wolf</li>
</ol>
<p>This story teaches the importance of honesty. It warns against lying, because people will stop listening if they think you’re always exaggerating.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The Ugly Duckling</li>
</ol>
<p>This story teaches the lesson that everyone is beautiful in their own way. No one is perfect, and everyone has something special to offer.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The Lion and the Mouse</li>
</ol>
<p>This story teaches the lesson of kindness. It shows how a small act of generosity can go a long way.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>The Ant and the Grasshopper</li>
</ol>
<p>This story teaches the lesson of preparation. It teaches that it’s important to work hard now so you can enjoy later rewards.</p>
<h1 id="Who-compiled-the-20-moral-stories"><a href="#Who-compiled-the-20-moral-stories" class="headerlink" title="Who compiled the 20 moral stories?"></a>Who compiled the 20 moral stories?</h1><p>There is some debate surrounding the identity of the compiler of the 20 moral stories. The most commonly accepted theory is that a Chinese philosopher and legalist, named Han Fei, compiled them sometime during the Warring States period (403-221 BC). However, there is no definitive proof of this and some scholars believe that they may have originated in India instead.</p>
<h1 id="Are-the-20-moral-stores-appropriate-for-kids"><a href="#Are-the-20-moral-stores-appropriate-for-kids" class="headerlink" title="Are the 20 moral stores appropriate for kids?"></a>Are the 20 moral stores appropriate for kids?</h1><p>Most parents want their children to have a strong moral compass, but what if there are just too many right things to do? How can you teach your children which of the 20 moral stores are appropriate for them?</p>
<p>One option is to let them figure it out for themselves. With guidance from you, they will learn how to think critically and make good decisions. But this process takes time and can be difficult, especially if your child is still young.</p>
<p>Another option is to pick and choose from the 20 moral stores to create a customized set of morals for your child. This approach can be tailored to your child’s age, personality, and interests.</p>
<p>The third option is to use a pre-determined set of morals that are appropriate for kids. This approach takes the guesswork out of it for you and can be helpful if you’re not sure where to start.</p>
<p>The 20 moral stores that we will explore in this article are based on the work of Alfie Kohn, an educational writer and lecturer specializing in human behavior, cooperation, and self-esteem. His list of moral stores has been adapted for kids and includes the following: </p>
<p>be honest;<br>be polite;<br>do your best;<br>help others;<br>share;<br>take turns;<br>listen;<br>follow directions;<br>respect differences;<br>don’t hurt people or animals;  </p>
<p>Page 1: Introducing the 20 Moral Stores for Kids</p>
<p>Each one of these moral stores has something important to offer your child. As they learn more about these values, they will grow into compassionate and responsible adults. Let’s take a closer look at each one of them.</p>
<h1 id="How-were-the-20-moral-stores-chosen"><a href="#How-were-the-20-moral-stores-chosen" class="headerlink" title="How were the 20 moral stores chosen?"></a>How were the 20 moral stores chosen?</h1><p>The 20 moral stories were chosen because they are representative of the range of moral issues people face in their everyday lives. The stories were selected to provoke reflection and discussion on a variety of moral issues, from honesty and loyalty to kindness and forgiveness.</p>
<h1 id="Do-the-20-moral-stores-have-a-unifying-theme"><a href="#Do-the-20-moral-stores-have-a-unifying-theme" class="headerlink" title="Do the 20 moral stores have a unifying theme?"></a>Do the 20 moral stores have a unifying theme?</h1><p>One of the primary purposes of morality is to provide a shared code of conduct that allows people to get along with one another. Moral codes can vary between cultures, but there are some universal themes. The 20 moral stores from the Mahabharata, a Hindu epic, might have a unifying theme.</p>
<p>The Mahabharata is about a civil war between two branches of a royal family. The war is fought over who will inherit the throne. The Pandavas are the rightful heirs, but they are forced into exile for 13 years. When they return, they have to fight their cousins, the Kauravas, for control of the kingdom.</p>
<p>The Pandavas are moral and principled, while the Kauravas are cruel and ruthless. The Kauravas use dirty tactics to win the war, while the Pandavas stick to honorable means. In the end, the Pandavas prevail due to their superior morality.</p>
<p>The moral lessons from the Mahabharata can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stick to your principles even in difficult times.</li>
<li>Do what is right, even if it is unpopular.</li>
<li>Be kind and compassionate towards others.</li>
<li>Treat everyone equally, regardless of their station in life.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="Where-does-her-power-come-from"><a href="#Where-does-her-power-come-from" class="headerlink" title="Where does her power come from?"></a>Where does her power come from?</h1><p>Wonder Woman is a popular comic book superheroine and one of the most powerful female superheroes in the DC Comics universe. She was created by psychologist William Moulton Marston and artist Harry G. Peter, and first appeared in All-Star Comics #8 in December 1941. Wonder Woman has also been featured in a wide variety of other media, including television series, movies, and video games.</p>
<p>So where does Wonder Woman’s power come from? One theory is that it stems from her magical “Bracelets of Submission.” These bracelets were given to her by the gods as a gift and are said to imprison the spirit of Ares, the God of War. By wearing them, Wonder Woman is able to suppress her own violent tendencies and channel Ares’ power instead. This makes her incredibly powerful in battle and able to defeat even the strongest opponents.</p>
<p>Another source of Wonder Woman’s power may be her sheer willpower and determination. She is a determined warrior who never gives up, no matter how tough the challenge may be. She has also demonstrated great wisdom and compassion, which helps her inspire others and lead them to victory.</p>
<p>Whatever the source of her power, Wonder Woman is an inspiring figure and one of the most popular superheroes of all time.</p>

<h1 id="What-happens-in-the-end"><a href="#What-happens-in-the-end" class="headerlink" title="What happens in the end?"></a>What happens in the end?</h1><p>No one really knows what happens when we die. Some people believe in an afterlife, while others think that death is the end of everything. We may never know what happens for sure, but that doesn’t stop us from wondering.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different theories about what happens after we die. Some people believe that we go to a different dimension, or that we become ghosts. Others believe that we simply return to the earth and are recycled into new life forms. There are even some people who believe that we are reincarnated into other animals or people.</p>
<p>What happens when we die is something that has been debated by humans for centuries. No one can say for sure what happens, but it’s a topic that always fascinates us. Even though we may never know for sure what happens, it’s interesting to think about all the possibilities.</p>
