        <h1 id="Online-Gambling-Illegal-in-Africa-–-Unless-You’re-in-These-Countries"><a href="#Online-Gambling-Illegal-in-Africa-–-Unless-You’re-in-These-Countries" class="headerlink" title="Online Gambling Illegal in Africa – Unless You’re in These Countries"></a>Online Gambling Illegal in Africa – Unless You’re in These Countries</h1><p>Online gambling is a contentious issue all over the world, but in Africa it is particularly fraught because of the various religious and cultural sensitivities around it.</p>
<p>In most African countries, online gambling is illegal. This means that players can’t access international gaming sites, and they can’t gamble with local companies either. The only exception to this rule is South Africa, which has liberalized its online gambling laws in recent years.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this strict stance on online gambling in Africa. First, many African countries are deeply religious, and there is a general belief that gambling is sinful. Second, there is a concern that online gambling could lead to financial ruin for many people who can’t afford to lose money. Finally, there is the perception that online gambling is linked to crime and corruption, which many African governments want to avoid.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, there is growing demand for online gambling in Africa. This is partly because of the increasing availability of mobile phones and internet access, but it’s also because Africans are increasingly comfortable with using digital technologies for banking and other activities. In fact, some experts believe that the African market for online gambling could be worth billions of dollars in the near future.</p>
<p>So far, only South Africa has fully embraced online gambling in Africa. Other countries are starting to relax their laws a bit, but there are still significant restrictions on how people can gamble online. This means that African players have to be careful if they want to gamble online – they need to make sure they’re playing on a site that’s allowed in their country.</p>
<h1 id="6-African-Countries-Where-Online-Gambling-Is-Legal"><a href="#6-African-Countries-Where-Online-Gambling-Is-Legal" class="headerlink" title="6 African Countries Where Online Gambling Is Legal"></a>6 African Countries Where Online Gambling Is Legal</h1><p>Online gambling is legal in a number of African countries, including:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>South Africa<br>South Africa is one of the most popular destinations for online gambling in Africa. The country’s Gambling Board oversees online gambling and issues licenses to approved operators. There are a number of reputable online casinos based in South Africa, offering players a wide range of slots, table games and other casino favourites.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Kenya<br>Kenya has been steadily growing in popularity as an online gambling destination. The country’s Betting Control and Licensing Board issues licenses to approved operators, and there are a number of well- established Kenyan online casinos. Players can enjoy a wide range of games, including slots, blackjack, roulette and baccarat.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nigeria<br>Nigeria is another major African gaming jurisdiction, with a number of reputable licensed operators. The National Lottery Commission regulates gambling in the country, and players can enjoy a wide range of games at some of the best Nigerian online casinos. These include slots, table games, live dealer games and even sports betting.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Zimbabwe<br>Zimbabwe has liberalised its gambling laws in recent years, making it an increasingly popular destination for online casino players. The Gambling Act permits licensed operators to offer a range of casino games to players over the age of 18. There are a number of excellent Zimbabwean-based casinos that offer players a great gaming experience, with bonuses and promotions available on top of the excellent game selection.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Zambia<br>The Gambling Act 2015 made Zambia one from the first African countries to legalise online gambling with regulated local licences given out to qualified applicants . The arrival of regulated iGaming in Zambia has seen increased transparency within the industry as well as player protection measures being put into place . This all makes Zambian-licensed igaming operations some of the most credible on the continent . Top Zambian-licensed casinos include Casino Africa , Zigzag 777 and PoloBet .<br>Players can enjoy a variety of casino games at these sites , such as slots , blackjack , roulette and baccarat . Live dealer games are also available , as well as sports betting .</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>6 . Morocco </p>
<p>Morocco was one the first African countries to legalise remote gaming via its enactment of decree No 2-12-405 in 2012 . This set out the regulatory framework under which online gaming would be offered in Morocco . Licensees were able to apply for permits through February 2013 with only two successful applications being granted before sweeping amendments were made in January 2014 that all but killed off remote gaming in Morocco save for horse racing bets . In spite this licensing ambiguity , some bold entrepreneurs took their chances and continued offering unlicensed remote gaming services thereby opening themselves up to possible criminal prosecution at any time ; albeit this has yet happened as far as we know . So far so good then for Moroccans wishing to gamble online but they will likely have better luck if they head north west into Europe where Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries dominate – or alternatively go east into Asia where Singapore offers world - class iGaming amenities</p>
<h1 id="South-Africa-Online-Gambling-is-Legal-But-Regulations-Are-a-Bit-Murky"><a href="#South-Africa-Online-Gambling-is-Legal-But-Regulations-Are-a-Bit-Murky" class="headerlink" title="South Africa: Online Gambling is Legal, But Regulations Are a Bit Murky"></a>South Africa: Online Gambling is Legal, But Regulations Are a Bit Murky</h1><p>Since 2010, online gambling has been legal in South Africa. This makes the country a desirable destination for online gambling platforms and operators. However, as is often the case with new industries, there are some regulatory grey areas that require clarification.</p>
<p>One such area is advertising. While it is not illegal to advertise online gambling in South Africa, the National Gambling Board (SARB) issued a circular in February this year stating that all gambling advertising should carry a caveat indicating that it is gambling and not a game of skill. This caveat must be in capital letters and appear on at least 30% of the ad.</p>
<p>The SARB has also released guidelines around which media platforms can be used to advertise gambling. The list includes print media, radio, television, cinemas, billboards, public transport and internet service providers (ISPs). However, the board advised that ads should not be placed on websites or social media platforms targeting children or youth.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there are no restrictions around who can gamble in South Africa. This means that people of all ages can participate in online gambling activities. In light of this, the SARB has urged players to gamble responsibly and avoid placing bets that could lead to financial distress.</p>
<p>While the regulatory framework around online gambling is still being clarified, it seems that South Africa is open to online gambling and is keen to ensure that players are protected.</p>
<h1 id="Kenya-Considers-Making-Online-Gambling-Illegal"><a href="#Kenya-Considers-Making-Online-Gambling-Illegal" class="headerlink" title="Kenya Considers Making Online Gambling Illegal"></a>Kenya Considers Making Online Gambling Illegal</h1><p>Kenya is presently debating whether or not to make online gambling illegal. The proposal has come about as a result of recent research that suggests that as many as 9 in 10 Kenyans gamble online, with most of them using their smartphones to do so. The government is concerned that the vast majority of people who are gambling online are not doing so responsibly and are risking losing large sums of money.</p>
<p>The proposed bill would make it illegal for any Kenyan citizen to gamble online, regardless of whether they are doing so from within the country or abroad. It would also be illegal for any company to offer online gambling services to Kenyans. If the bill is passed into law, those caught violating it could face fines or imprisonment.</p>
<p>The government says that it wants to protect Kenyans from the risks associated with online gambling. These include addiction, financial hardship, and exposure to corruption. However, some people have criticised the proposal, arguing that it will deprive Kenyans of a legitimate form of entertainment and deprive the government of much-needed revenue.</p>
<p>Online gambling is currently legal in Kenya, but there are no regulations governing it. This means that there is no way to ensure that people are gambling responsibly or that companies are operating fairly. The government believes that making online gambling illegal will help address these issues.</p>
<h1 id="Uganda-Could-Criminalize-Online-Gambling-in-Near-Future"><a href="#Uganda-Could-Criminalize-Online-Gambling-in-Near-Future" class="headerlink" title="Uganda Could Criminalize Online Gambling in Near Future"></a>Uganda Could Criminalize Online Gambling in Near Future</h1><p>The Ugandan government is planning to pass a new bill that would outlaw online gambling in the country. The proposed bill, which is currently making its way through parliament, would make it illegal for Ugandans to gamble online or use electronic devices for any form of gambling.</p>
<p>Ugandan officials say that the proposed bill is necessary to protect citizens from the harmful effects of gambling. They argue that online gambling can lead to addiction and financial hardship, and that it can also be used to launder money and facilitate other criminal activities.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it will do more harm than good. They say that it will deprive Ugandans of a legitimate form of entertainment, and that it will also lead to widespread unemployment as people lose their jobs in the country’s struggling gambling industry.</p>
<p>The fate of the proposed bill is still uncertain, but if it is passed into law, it could have a significant impact on online gambling in Uganda.</p>
