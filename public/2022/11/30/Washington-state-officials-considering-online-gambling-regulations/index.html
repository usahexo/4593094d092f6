It will be interesting to see what decisions Washington state officials make regarding this proposed regulation.</h1><h1 id="Washington-to-join-other-states-in-regulating-online-gambling"><a href="#Washington-to-join-other-states-in-regulating-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Washington to join other states in regulating online gambling?"></a>Washington to join other states in regulating online gambling?</h1><p>On January 8, 2018, the Washington State Gambling Commission (WSGC) voted unanimously to propose new regulations for online gambling. The proposed rules would require gambling companies doing business in the state to have a physical presence there.</p>
<p>This would make Washington the latest in a string of states to regulate online gambling. Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware have all implemented similar laws, while Pennsylvania is currently considering a bill to do the same.</p>
<p>The proposed regulations in Washington are intended to address two main issues: consumer protection and tax revenue collection.</p>
<p>With respect to consumer protection, the WSGC is concerned about problems such as underage gambling and addiction. Under the proposed rules, online gambling companies would be required to verify the age of their customers and take measures to protect against addiction.</p>
<p>In addition, the WSGC wants gambling companies to pay taxes on their revenues from Washington residents. This could provide a new stream of revenue for the state government at a time when it is facing budget deficits.</p>
<p>Opposition to the proposed regulations has been limited so far. However, some people are concerned that they could lead to increased prices for consumers and fewer jobs in the online gambling industry.</p>
<p>The WSGC plans to hold a public hearing on the proposed rules later this month and will then make a final decision on whether to implement them.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-state-lawmakers-weigh-in-on-online-gambling"><a href="#Washington-state-lawmakers-weigh-in-on-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Washington state lawmakers weigh in on online gambling"></a>Washington state lawmakers weigh in on online gambling</h1><p>Online gambling has been a hot topic in legislatures across the United States, and Washington state is no exception. Lawmakers there are currently debating a measure that would allow licensed and regulated online gambling in the state.</p>
<p>The proposed bill would let anyone over 21 years old gamble online, as long as they’re playing at one of the approved sites. The idea is to generate new revenue for the state by taxing operators and players alike.</p>
<p>Washington isn’t the only state considering this approach; Illinois, New York, and Pennsylvania are among those also exploring regulated online gambling. But some lawmakers in Washington are concerned that the proposal goes too far.</p>
<p>Republican State Senator Curtis King is one of them. He says that he doesn’t want to see gambling become so readily available that it becomes a problem for people. “It just seems like it’s opening a can of worms,” he said.</p>
<p>Democrats, on the other hand, see potential benefits to regulated online gambling. Representative Timm Ormsby argues that it could be a major source of new revenue for the state. “This will be an important step forward in modernizing our laws and generating much-needed new tax revenue for our schools and other vital services,” he said.</p>
<p>The fate of the proposed bill remains to be seen, but it offers a glimpse into how states are grappling with the issue of online gambling. For many lawmakers, it comes down to finding a way to balance potential benefits with possible risks.</p>
<h1 id="Online-gambling-debate-heating-up-in-Washington-state"><a href="#Online-gambling-debate-heating-up-in-Washington-state" class="headerlink" title="Online gambling debate heating up in Washington state"></a>Online gambling debate heating up in Washington state</h1><p>As the online gambling debate heats up in Washington state, two very different bills have been introduced in the Senate.</p>
<p>SB 6612, sponsored by Senator Margarita Prentice, would legalize and regulate online poker and casino games. The bill is modeled after regulations in Nevada and New Jersey, where such activities are already legal and regulated.</p>
<p>SB 6552, sponsored by Senator Don Benton, would make it a felony to use the internet to gamble in Washington state. The bill would also prohibit any financial institution from processing transactions related to online gambling.</p>
<p>The introduction of these two bills highlights the split among lawmakers about how to best handle online gambling. Those in favor of legalized and regulated online gambling argue that it would bring much-needed revenue to the state, while providing jobs and consumer protections. Opponents of online gambling argue that it is too risky and could lead to addiction and other problems.</p>
<p>Washington is not the only state considering how to deal with online gambling. In February, New Jersey became the first state to offer legal and regulated online gambling, including poker, blackjack, and slots. Several other states are also considering legalizing online gambling, including California, Illinois, Iowa, and Maine.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no definitive answer as to whether online gambling will be legalized in Washington state. However, the debate is sure to continue as lawmakers consider the pros and cons of this issue.</p>
<h1 id="Is-it-time-for-Washington-to-regulate-online-gambling"><a href="#Is-it-time-for-Washington-to-regulate-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Is it time for Washington to regulate online gambling?"></a>Is it time for Washington to regulate online gambling?</h1><p>It has been just over a year since the US Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on sports gambling, and since then, lawmakers in a number of states have taken up the issue of online gambling. In some cases, lawmakers are looking to specifically legalize online gambling, while in others they are looking to regulate it in the same way that brick-and-mortar gambling is currently regulated.</p>
<p>Supporters of regulating online gambling argue that it can be a source of revenue for states, and that it can also be a way to protect consumers from illegal and unregulated gambling. Critics argue that online gambling can be addictive, and that it can also be used by criminals to launder money.</p>
<p>So far, only a handful of states have taken any action on regulating online gambling. In New Jersey, for example, lawmakers have passed a bill that would legalize and regulate online casinos. The bill is currently awaiting approval from Governor Phil Murphy. In Pennsylvania, lawmakers are considering a bill that would allow for both online casino gaming and online poker.</p>
<p>In Michigan, lawmakers are considering a bill that would prohibit online gambling altogether. And in Hawaii, lawmakers are considering a bill that would require operators of online gambling sites to obtain licenses from the state gaming commission.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no action on regulating online gambling at the federal level. But it is possible that could change in the coming years, especially as more states consider legalizing or regulating online gambling.</p>
